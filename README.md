# hello-world
My first repository 
Ok, So i am learning how to do this stuff. Trying to branch out and learn new things, improve myself and become a better version of myself in general. I think now is the perfect time to get into something like this...this being cyber security and coding and all this other jazz im going to learn about. Seems like the time is ripe for this, especially with how the world is shaping up. We're about to enter some wild times, so new skills that are valuable seem like the route to go. Anyways, about myself...not much to say. Done some things, seen some things, been some places.The usual. Nothing really sets me that much apart from most other people on the basics...depending on how you look at things I suppose. Regardless, Im more interested in what all this means more than anything else. I need to learn how to mold my mind to these skills. Gotta feeling they'll be important further down the road.
